# Musical Patterns - main

## bin

`deploy.sh`

Sends the `lab` up to GCP.

`setup.sh`

Sets up your environment, including cloning down all the projects as siblings to main.
It's not always best to do your development in `main`.

`start.sh`

Starts up the `lab` locally.

`update.sh MSG="new wave"`

Begins with the `cli` and working its way through the stack of intra-project dependencies up to the `lab`.
Each stop it updates dependencies, commits, pushes, and publishes.
